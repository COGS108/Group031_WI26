        "Within the National Basketball Association (NBA), the standard 82-game regular season involves a high density of competition interspersed with frequent transmeridian travel, creating a unique environment where athletic performance is perpetually modulated by recovery status and circadian alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Travel stress in this context is characterized by two distinct but overlapping phenomena: travel fatigue—the acute exhaustion from the logistics of movement—and jet lag, a circadian rhythm disorder caused by crossing multiple time zones. This biological asymmetry is critical, as the human circadian system is naturally more adept at adapting to westward travel (phase delay) than shortening its cycle through eastward travel (phase advance) <a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research indicates that sleep disruption is the primary mechanism through which travel stress erodes performance. On the first night after travel, athletes experience a predictable reduction in sleep duration based on the number of time zones crossed, with eastward travel being significantly more disruptive (averaging -24.5 minutes) than westward travel <a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a><sup>2</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "These disruptions can manifest as significant decrements in Offensive Efficiency (OE), a holistic metric that measures scoring effectiveness per possession. Specifically, studies have shown that eastward jet lag is associated with a 1.2% decrease in Effective Field Goal Percentage ($eFG\\%$) differential <a name=\"cite_note-3\"></a><sup>3</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, mental fatigue disrupts psychomotor vigilance, essential for shooting accuracy and ball security, often leading to a rise in turnover rates (TOV%) at the end of long road trips.\n",
        "\n",
        "Existing literature has also identified specific \"tipping points\" where travel fatigue becomes the dominant predictor of performance variance. One of the most robust findings is that cumulative time zone changes of three or more within a three-day period are significantly detrimental to performance <a name=\"cite_note-4\"></a><sup>4</sup>.\n",

        "This dataset provides official NBA regular season schedule information for every NBA\n",
        "regular season game across six seasons (2020-21 through 2024-25), parsed from structured\n",
        "JSON schedule files. The final cleaned dataset contains approximately 6,000+ game\n",
        "observations (30 teams, ~82 games per season ÷ 2 × 6 seasons) across 9 columns.\n",
        "Each row represents one NBA game, meaning each observation includes both a home\n",
        "and away team.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data was parsed from season-specific JSON files (`nba_schedule_<season>.json`).\n",
        "For each month and game entry within the nested JSON structure, we extracted the\n",
        "game date, home and away team names and abbreviations, arena name, and final scores.\n",
        "After parsing, we filtered the dataset to include only official NBA franchises\n",
        "(30 teams), ensuring removal of malformed or non-standard entries. This dataset\n",
        "forms the structural backbone for constructing travel-related variables central\n",
        "to our research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key variables and what they mean:**\n",
        "\n",
        "`season` identifies the NBA season (e.g., 2020 corresponds to the 2020-21 season).\n",
        "This allows us to group games within team-season sequences for chronological travel\n",
        "calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "`date` is the official game date, converted to datetime format. This variable is\n",
        "essential for computing inter-game rest intervals and sequencing consecutive\n",
        "games for each team.\n",
        "\n",
        "`home_team` and `away_team` are full franchise names. `home_abbr` and\n",
        "`away_abbr` provide standardized team abbreviations that enable merging\n",
        "with team-level performance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "`arena` identifies the venue where the game was played. This variable is\n",
        "critical because it allows us to merge in geographic coordinates (latitude\n",
        "and longitude) from a separate arena-location dataset. These coordinates\n",
        "enable calculation of travel distance between consecutive game locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "`home_score` and `away_score` represent final game outcomes and allow calculation\n",
        "of game margin (`home_score − away_score`), which can later be used to measure\n",
        "performance relative to expectation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset enables construction of the independent variables measuring\n",
        "cumulative travel stress. Using chronological sorting within each team-season,\n",
        "we can compute location transitions, road trip length (consecutive away games),\n",
        "travel distance between arenas, and time-zone shifts between consecutive games.\n",
        "These engineered variables allow us to operationalize geographic and circadian\n",
        "stress, which we hypothesize predicts declines in offensive efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Concerns with this dataset:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary limitation is that arena names do not inherently include geographic\n",
        "coordinates; latitude, longitude, and time zone data must be merged from an\n",
        "external source. Travel distances are therefore approximations based on direct\n",
        "arena-to-arena displacement and do not reflect actual charter flight routes or\n",
        "delays.\n",
        "\n",
        "A secondary concern is the absence of game start time, which restricts our\n",
        "ability to directly measure circadian misalignment (e.g., body-clock disadvantage\n",
        "following eastward travel).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the **2020-21 season** contains fewer games per team (72 instead of 82)\n",
        "due to the delayed COVID-era start. This season also features a more compressed\n",
        "schedule with proportionally more back-to-backs. We retain it in the dataset\n",
        "but flag it as a potential moderator in robustness checks."
